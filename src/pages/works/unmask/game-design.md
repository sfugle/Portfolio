A capstone project, Unmask focused on the field of "serious games" â€” games that are centered on a real world topic like climate change, immigration, or identity.
Choosing the topic of neurodiverse, I focused on simulating part of the neurodiverse social experience: trying to "catch up" and learn the social rules without getting called out.
Thus, Unmask was designed to accentuate the difficulties of learning in an unfamiliar environment, something that can be seen all throughout its desgin.
